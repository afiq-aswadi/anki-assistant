# Anki Copilot

Anki Copilot is an addon for Anki that enhances your flashcards by making AI-powered improvements to your cards. The addon uses the Claude API to provide suggestions for your cards. The suggestions are based on the content of your cards and the settings you choose.

The addon is *not* intended to independently create cards for you. It is meant to be used as a tool to help you improve your cards and thus make your study sessions more efficient. 

## Features

- **Add explanations**: Add explanations to cards that may be ambiguous or unclear.
- **Add examples**: Add examples to cards that may be difficult to understand.
- **Add related cards**: Add related cards to cards that may have missing context.
- **Custom suggestions**: Provide a prompt to the AI to generate custom suggestions based on your needs.
